# SVG Folder

This folder contains individual SVG files for each icon in the Never Icons set. These SVGs are intended for designers and can be imported into Figma or other design tools.

- Each file is named after the icon it represents (e.g., `github.svg`, `twitter.svg`).
- SVGs are exported from IcoMoon or the original source.

> Do not edit these files directly. Update the source SVGs and re-export as needed.
