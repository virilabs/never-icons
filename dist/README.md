# dist/ â€“ Never Icons Distribution

This folder contains the built assets for the Never Icons package. These files are generated by the build process and are intended for use in production or integration with other projects.

## Contents

- **css/**  
  Minified and source-mapped CSS files for the icon font.

- **fonts/never-icons/**  
  Webfont files (`.eot`, `.svg`, `.ttf`, `.woff`) for use with the CSS.

## Usage

1. **Include the CSS in your HTML:**

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/never-icons.min.css">
   ```

2. **Reference icons in your markup:**

   ```html
   <i class="nv-never nv-github"></i>
   ```

3. **Ensure the fonts are accessible at the path referenced by the CSS.**

## Notes

- Do **not** edit files in this folder directly; they are overwritten by the build process.
- For source files and icon management, see the `src/` directory.
- For a demo and usage examples, see the `demo/` folder.
